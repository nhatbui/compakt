[Compakt in action! (youtube)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twy-K8oruDc)

## Features
* Compresses repeated text e.g. "kappa kappa kappa" = "kappa x3"
* Compresses repeated emotes similar to how text is compressed.
* Repeated messages are grouped together.
* See a list of all the users who uttered the same message.

## How to use it
* Just install and visit a Twitch stream to see it in action.
* (Options menu coming soon!)
